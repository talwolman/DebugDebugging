on a serious note, rubber duck debugging is a great great strategy. It gives you "someone" to talk to and you often will figure out what is wrong simply by talking out loud and explaining it to the bug. I have often gone to office hours and started explaining my bug to a TA and ended up figuring it out as I was explaining it because vocalizing helped a lot!
