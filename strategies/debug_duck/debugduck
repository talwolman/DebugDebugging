My web development professor introduced us to rubber duck debugging. She even provided rubber ducks in costumes on Halloween! However, as I was working on a particular homework assignment and grabbed some ice cream and realized I could implement my own debugging strategy. debugging ice cream! As I code, every time I encounter a bug I motivate myself by taking a bite of ice cream when it has been debugged. It truly is the gift that keeps on giving because as I get more bugs, I get more ice cream AND more experience with efficient debugging. truly a win win situation!
