Break points are your best friend! I learned how to debug in this class by learning the power of setting break points. Find a spot in your code, set the point and move step by step until you can identify what the issue is. While stepping through your code you will also learn to understand and use the information the browser provides you. Don't overlook this, use it to your power.
