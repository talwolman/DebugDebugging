If all else fails, give yourself a break, get up, eat a snack, drink some water and give yourself a designated amount of time to destress and check out. Just don't forget to come back to your work. I personally recommend watching some Dr. Phil clips on YouTube. It helps you realize that there are people with much larger (and much stranger) issues than your bug :)
